### Customize the test machine
machine:

  timezone:
    UTC # Set the timezone
  java:
    version: openjdk7

  # Override /etc/hosts
  hosts:
    circlehost: 127.0.0.1

## Customize dependencies

  # we automatically cache and restore many dependencies between
  # builds. If you need to, you can add custom paths to cache:

test:
  override:
    - mvn clean package

general:
  artifacts:
    - "target/"

deployment:
  production: 
    branch: master
    commands:
      - curl --upload-file target/*.war "http://tomcat:tomcat@54.224.127.242:8080/manager/deploy?path=/&update=true"
